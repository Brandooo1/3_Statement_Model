# 3_Statement_Model
This repository demonstrates the use of a 3-Statement Model I created. I used it in a stock pitch. The model provided baseline information for developing a well-informed discounted cash flow valuation. I used information from Capital IQ, created the model from scratch, and used it to gain admission into Investment Club at my school!
